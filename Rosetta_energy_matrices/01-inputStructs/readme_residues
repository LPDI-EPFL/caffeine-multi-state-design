The runs were divided into clusters of residues, Group A  for now. 

The multistate design is as follows. The prefix "syn" means synthetic and means that the protein is mutable according to s.
We have synCafA and synCafB

%%%%
Multistate optimization objective for heterodimer

min_s { 
  (-E(synCafB:CFF:synCafH) + E(synCafB:CFF:synCafB) + E(synCafH:CFF:synCafH)) 
}

%%%%
Constraints:

(E(synCafB:CFF:synCafH) <= E(wtCafA:CFF:wtCafA) + \epsilon


(E(synCafB:CFF) <= E(wtCafA:CFF) + \epsilon
(E(synCafG:CFF) <= E(wtCafA:CFF) + \epsilon

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If possible, make chain B mostly negative and chain H mostly positive
